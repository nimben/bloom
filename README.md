Bloom Forecasting and Visualization System
üå∏ Overview
Bloom is a comprehensive system for forecasting and visualizing blooming seasons worldwide. It combines machine learning predictions with interactive 3D web visualizations to help users track and explore nature's blooming cycles. The system consists of a FastAPI backend for data processing and forecasting, and a React-based frontend for immersive user experiences.

üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The project is organized into two main components:

Backend (backend/): Python FastAPI service handling data processing, ML forecasting, and API endpoints
Frontend (blossom-watch/): React web application with 3D visualizations and interactive maps
üöÄ Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+
Node.js 16+
Google Earth Engine account (for NDVI data)
Gemini API key (for chatbot functionality)
